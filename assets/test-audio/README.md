# Test Audio Files

Put your test audio files here:

- test1.m4a
- test2.m4a

These files will be bundled with your app for testing in the simulator.

## How to add real audio files:

1. Find or create some short audio files (M4A, MP3, WAV)
2. Rename them to test1.m4a and test2.m4a  
3. Copy them to this folder
4. The TestAudioPicker component will load them automatically

## For quick testing:
- You can record a short voice memo on your Mac
- Export it as M4A format
- Copy it here

## Alternative:
- The component will create mock files if real audio files are not found
- Mock files test the upload/processing workflow but won't have real audio content
